Hello I`m Hydro, a developer from Jersey. I write code, often about things that i will never even use again.

I started messing with code a little in 2016, starting with very basic Node.JS and some basic HTML & CSS only web pages. I have been writing more code every year since, as my GitHub profile shows.

I mostly use Java and JavaScript, however I would like to give Go and Rust a try in the future.
